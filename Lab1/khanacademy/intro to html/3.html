    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    
    <p>The <strong>violetears</strong> are hummingbirds of the genus <strong><em>Colibri</em></strong>. They are medium to large species found in <em>Mexico</em>, and <em>Central and northern South America</em>. The <em>Mexican</em> violetear occasionally wanders as far north as the <em>United States</em> and even <em>Canada</em>. <br><br>
    <strong> Violetears build substantial cup nests into which two white eggs are laid. They have loud persistent songs, often repetitions of double notes. </strong>
