    <h2> Lyrics </h2>
    <h4> [Intro] </h4>
    <p> One, two </p>
    <h4> [Verse 1]</h4>
    <p> It's been a couple months <br>
    That's just about enough time <br>
    For me to stop crying when I look at all the pictures <br>
    Now I kinda smile, I haven't felt that in a while <br>
    It's late, I hear the doorbell ringin' and it's pourin' <br>
    I open up that door, see your brown eyes at the entrance <br>
    You just wanna talk, and I can't turn away a wet dog </p>
    <h4> [Pre-Chorus] </h4>
    <p> But, please, don't ruin this for me <br>
    Please, don't make it harder than it already is <br>
    I'm trying to get over this </p>
    <h4> [Chorus] </h4>
    <p> I wish that you would stay in my memories <br>
    But you show up today, just to ruin things <br>
    I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized <br>
    But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight <br>
    You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position <br>
    Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say <br>
    "I wish that you would stay in my memories" <br>
    In my memories, stay in my memories </p>   
</body>
